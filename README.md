# WordWide

What is this app?
WordWide is an original project that allows creators to face other beginners as well as advanced writers.
We write short stories in it, which are then evaluated and commented on. Ultimately, stories with the highest ratings will be regularly awarded and promoted, which gives the opportunity to 'be noticed'.
To give each writer a equal chance, a hero (including his photo and biography), world, genre and title will be drawn.



Where did the idea come from?
Many years ago I participated in similar competitions myself, but then I had to write stories by hand and send them by letters.
To facilitate and speed up this process, this application was created.

Objective:
Promoting young talents.
Great fun and a nice time.
Polishing your writing skills.
Opportunity to face others.
No 'blank page' problem.
Intellectual development.

Technologies used: Python, Django Framework, PostgreSQL, Boostrap.
The application has been tested using Pytest.
I work on branches and pull requests to further train my Git skills.
